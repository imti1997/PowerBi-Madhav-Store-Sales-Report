Insights:
•	Key performance indicators (KPIs) used to be determined based on niche, vision, and short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals of a business, profit per month in states, category, sub-category of the products.
•	The sales team is generating leads which is important as lack of leads implies a lukewarm or cold performance. It can also mean that the target audiences are entirely wrong and have nothing to do with the product or service you offer.
•	Customer retention is the most important KPI to measure for any business. Spending excess amounts on acquiring new customers will not deliver long-term results if the current ones don’t stay with your business. Retaining your customers is vital to increase brand value in the market.
•	The payment mode option- a greater number of customers using COD (cash on delivery) and business can offer some discount to cardholders.
•	Sales Growth per Month -The profit earned in the month of November are maximum as compared to other months due to winter sales on website.

•	The state Maharashtra, U.P, and M.P are having maximum purchases, it is important to focus on these states and provide some especial offers also focus on inventory to cope up the demand
